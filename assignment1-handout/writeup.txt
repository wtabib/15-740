1a) In the worst case, the measurement error will be 199.  In the best
case the measurement error is 1.  
If we start exactly on the tick, the delta period ends exactly on the
tick and we have some error because it ends up taking a whole tick.  If
we don’t end exactly on the tick, then the measurement isn’t exact and
we get some error.

((1/(2*10^4)) - 1/(10^2))/(1/(2*10^4)) = 199

1b)  In this case the additions take half a second and there are 50
deltas.  However, due to similar reasoning from (1a) it’s possible that
we measure 51 deltas instead of 50.  
Therefore, 

best case = (0.5 - 50*0.01)/0.5 = 0
worst case = (0.01/0.5) = 0.02
